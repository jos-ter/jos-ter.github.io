Welcome to the Demo Grant Bank.  
Check [your account](https://jos-ter.github.io "Demo Grant Bank") anytime and anywhere.  
  
  
Shall we make it an open source thing?  
  
  
Personally I was thinking:  
-accounts: username, password, products/services, geographic coordinate, verification from other peers.  
-overview: map/network/index with all accounts/products/services and public projects.  
-funtions: transfer money, propose public project.  
  
Any enthousiast programmers?
